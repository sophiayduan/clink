# July 31st: done

**Total time spent: 9h**

Last night I decided I wanted an eink clock and today was my last chance to make one, so I sat down and got TONS of work done. 

It's a eink display with wifi connectivity and a rotary encoder for manual control. It draws power from a LiPo battery but can also use USB-C (code uploaded through it too)
Based on my previous project I was familiar with the ESP-12F and its wifi capabilities so I chose for it to be my mcu for Clink. 

I recently jailbroke my kindle and become more interested in e-ink displays, I thought it'd be a good fit for Clink as I don't want it to emit light (so I can't see it in the dark).

I cadded this plain case, it was really rushed and I didn't realize that the rotary encoder has no way of being reached.

# August 1st: New look

**Total time spent: 4h**

Yesterday, I rushed a terrible CAD model and today my goal was to fix it. Once I began I realized it was really difficult and impractial to mount the PCB in a way that the rotary encoder could be used. 

I remade my PCB to better fit my case. The biggest change was making the rotary encoder come out from the side with my USB-C.

I really enjoyed routing a pcb that had few components and didn't have rigid requirements unlike my [3D printer tracker](https://github.com/sophiayduan/Endev-board).

For the case I opted for a retro vibe:

# August 3rd: Polish

**Total time spent: 3h**

Created a quick design in Canva just so I can have a nice render:

Then modified the CAD to allow the PCB to be screwed on from the bottom of the case.
