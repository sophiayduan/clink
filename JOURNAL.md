**Total time spent: 9h**

Last night I decided I wanted an eink clock and today was my last chance to get one, so I sat down and got lots of work done. 
It is a eink display controlled through usbc and can draw power from usbc and if that isn't plugged in then it uses a lipo battery.

I thought eink was perfect since I just need to see the time at my desk, but at night i'd prefer if it weren't visible.

Since this project was done in one journal entry, all the photos are in the read me.
